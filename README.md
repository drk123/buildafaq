=========

HTML5 App using [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/) to create multiple level FAQs

Check out the [demo](http://drk123.github.io/buildafaq/index.html)

buildafaq is intended to be an easy-to-use faq generator.  Build multi-level question sets by linking together blocks.  There are three types of questions and three types of answers.

Questions
---------
1. Multiple choice - a question with one or more nested questions.
2. Single - a question with a single answer.
3. Link - a link to another question
 
Answers
-------
1. Simple - a rich text answer with the ability to embed images and videos.
2. Link - a link to another web page
3. Nested - an answer with nested questions.
 
buildafaq makes extensive use of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework to generate responsive FAQs.  FAQs are easily embedded within existing web pages or as standalone pages.
